#Retail Demand Forecasting System

This project is a machine learning–based retail demand forecasting system designed to support store managers in procurement and inventory planning. Using historical sales data enriched with temporal features such as month, day of week, holidays, and promotions, the system predicts future product demand to help determine optimal purchase quantities.

The core model is built using CatBoostRegressor, which effectively captures non-linear relationships and seasonality patterns in sales data. The model enables data-driven procurement decisions, reduces overstocking and stockouts, and improves overall inventory efficiency.

The project covers the full machine learning pipeline, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and model persistence for reuse in production environments.
